You are given an array of both negative and positive integers. You need to rearrange the array such that positive and negative numbers alternate. Also, the order should be same as previous array and only O(1) auxiliary space can be used and time complexity boundation O(n). 
eg. -2 3 4 5 -1 -6 7 9 1 
result â€“ 3 -2 4 -1 5 -6 7 9 1.
